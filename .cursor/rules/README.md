# Cursor Rules for Spot Prices Project

These files guide the AI assistant within this workspace. They do not ship with the app. Keep them concise and high-signal. When decisions are finalized, mirror them in `RULES.md` at the repo root.

## Structure
- `project.md`: High-level goals and constraints
- `scope.md`: In/out of scope items
- `architecture.md`: Preferred architecture and tradeoffs
- `ux.md`: UX principles and key UI states
- `data.md`: Data sources, licensing notes, normalization
- `security.md`: Security & privacy constraints
- `testing.md`: Testing strategy and critical edge cases
- `workflow.md`: How to work in this repo (branching, reviews)
- `ci_cd.md`: CI/CD plan for GitHub Actions (self-hosted runner), deploys to `/srv/spot`

The assistant must follow these rules and avoid coding until plan/design are approved by the USER.
