# Scope and Non-Scope

## In Scope (MVP)
- Regions selector and two-day (today/tomorrow) price display
- Hourly chart and table with highlights (current, min, max)
- Unit toggles (EUR/MWh and c/kWh) and optional tax add-on toggle
- Empty/error states with publish countdown

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- Historical data beyond two days
- Notifications/alerts/schedules
- Accounts, profiles, or cloud persistence
- Complex tariff compositions beyond a flat VAT and margin add-on
